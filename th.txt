    What is dsa ?
    -> data structures and algorithms

        data structures -> is the way to store the data and organize it
        algorithms -> mean steps taken to make a decision


dsa types 

-> Liner
        -> array

        -> linked list
            -> singly linked list
            -> doubly linked list
            -> circular linked list
        -> stack
            -> array stack
            -> linked list stack    

        -> queue
            -> circular queue
            -> priority queue
            -> deque (double ended queue)
    

-> non-liner    
        -> tree
        -> graph



void main()
    void -> return type
    main -> function 
    () -> arguments
    {
        // code goes here
    }


array []


int a[10] -> 1D

[][] -> MD

a[0] - a[9]
0 1  2  3 4 .....-> index 


array always start with 0   

    ends with SIZE - 1

searching 
sorting
display
